## Description

* This is an official implementation of the Refined Exponential Solver (RES) sampling algorithm for diffusion models. 
* It also includes [a general framework](https://github.com/qsh-zh/res/blob/main/res.py#L568-L640) for implementing various sampling algorithms based on solving diffusion ODE/SDE.

## Update

* Aug 24, 2025. RES is quite popular in the open source community; see [r/StableDiffusion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/search/?q=res+sampler&cId=7ba15018-8719-4858-b1e9-550f02553248&iId=e7ae71b3-b714-4945-82c2-9693e4269c67). There are several good sampler/scheduler implementations based on RES. You may find the following repos helpful: [RES4LYF ComfyUI](https://github.com/ClownsharkBatwing/RES4LYF), [ComfyUI-Extra-Samplers](https://github.com/Clybius/ComfyUI-Extra-Samplers/blob/main/other_samplers/refined_exp_solver.py), and [webUI_ExtraSchedulers](https://github.com/DenOfEquity/webUI_ExtraSchedulers/blob/main/scripts/res_solver.py), which offer more engineering robustness and have been well tested. 

## Fun fact

This work was done during the summer of 2023 and got rejected by NeurIPS. I was sad and disappointed, so I didn't bother promoting or advertising the work and got busy with other stuff. I figured it was just another paper that few people would read due to all the verbose math.

Fast forward to August 2025, when a friend asked me [what is RES_2s](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mfzvl5/debate_best_wan_22_t2v_settings_steps_sampler_cfg/). That's when I realized, damn, this might actually be the work with the most users! Of course, the number of users far exceeds the citation count for the paper. ðŸ“ˆ
